## Projects
### Route optimization and delivery time prediction for Amazon Pola Siero
[Information of the new Center](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/amazon-empleos-pola-de-siero/)

I developed a machine learning model with data on traffic, weather, accidents and delivery times from 2011 to date from delivery companies in Spain, for which I had to extract the data using techniques such as webscraping, use of APIs and downloading. of files in various formats to transform and standardize the training data of my prediction model in Python. I then stored the prediction data in a PostgreSQL database and created a CRUD with FLASK.

### When is the best time to enter a bullet tournament in Lichess?
[Lichess](https://lichess.org/es/tournament)

I extracted the information from the various daily bullet tournaments played in Lichess for a rating of less than 2000 ELO points and performed EDA and visualization of the data to determine when the players' performance is worst and at what time there are fewer people against them. compete guaranteeing possibilities to level up more easily. Using libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, pandas and numpy.

### Where I can find the best house price in Asturias, Spain?
[Website](https://www.idealista.com/alquiler-viviendas/asturias/)

Through web scraping the first 10 pages I request access to the API from the web moderators who allowed me to download in real time all the information about the apartments for sale and rent in Asturias, to be able to predict future prices by sector and identify a purchasing opportunity.

### Credit Card Fraud detection

Developed and deployed machine learning classification models to identify fraudulent transactions. My work involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building models like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. I optimized model performance using techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, ensuring high accuracy in detecting fraudulent activities while minimizing false positives. Additionally, I collaborated with business stakeholders to implement the models into production systems, contributing to reduced fraud losses and improved financial security.
